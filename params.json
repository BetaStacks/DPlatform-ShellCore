Full support, well tested\r\n\r\nIf you use Ubuntu 14.04.x and you want to use SystemD services provided by DPlatform, you can switch to it instead of the default Upstart\r\n\r\nCentOS 7, Fedora and other RHEL derivatives. Good support, not fully tested\r\n\r\nArch Linux. Partial support, not tested\r\n\r\nA x86, x86-64 or armv[6,7,8] CPU.\r\n\r\nDevelopment is still active. Most things should work, but problems could occur, more testing is needed.\r\nPlease feel free to open an issue and create a pull request, all contributions are welcome!\r\n\r\n## Roadmap\r\n\r\n - [1] Install apps efficiently through a terminal UI - In progress\r\n - (2) DPlatform Web GUI to manage apps easily - Early prototypes started\r\n - (3) Build a custom image with DPlatform Web GUI auto-configuration - Planned\r\n - DNS and secure firewall pass-trough via [localtunnel](https://localtunnel.me/)\r\n - Enhance the security. [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/), Nginx reverse proxy, [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) certificate\r\n\r\n### Other informations\r\n\r\n ***The main goals of DPlatform are the independence, the freedom and the security. Therefore all installations and configurations provided through this set of shell tools are TOTALLY independents of DPlatform, and work perfectly without it***\r\n\r\nEach app have its own dedicated user, most their own `/home/app_user` directory\r\n\r\nIf you want to contribute, you should see [CONTRIBUTING.md](https://github.com/j8r/DPlatform/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)\r\n\r\n## Contributors - Special thanks\r\n[@cryptono](https://github.com/cryptono) - testing\r\n\r\n## License\r\nCopyright (c) 2015-2016 Julien Reichardt - [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) (MIT)\r\n",
